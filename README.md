This repository contains a Python package called `arcadia_microscopy_tools`. The purpose of this Python package is for facilitating analysis of large-scale microscopy datasets generated by Arcadia's imaging suite which includes several microscopes:
- Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2-E (Hina)
- Nikon ECLIPSE Ni-E (Babu Frik)
- Leica Stellaris 8 (The Borg)

This package provides tooling for image preprocessing, cell/particle segmentation, morphology analysis, fluorescence quantification, and batch processing pipelines. Supports native file formats (ND2 via [nd2](https://github.com/tlambert03/nd2) and LIF via [readlif](https://github.com/arcadia-science/readlif)) and integrates with popular scientific Python libraries for streamlined high-content screening and quantitative microscopy workflows.
